# Demonstrates that sequence IDs may not be inserted linearly with concurrent
# writers.
#
# This script writes events in parallel from a number of forked processes,
# writing events in a continious loop until the program is interrupted.
# The parent process detects gaps in sequence IDs by selecting the last 2
# events based on sequence ID. A gap is detected when the 2 IDs returned from
# that query aren't sequential. The script will proceed to execute 2 subsequent
# queries to see if they show up in the time it takes to complete those before
# moving on.
#
# An easier way to demonstrate this is by using 2 psql consoles:
#
# - Simulate a transaction taking a long time to commit:
#   ```
#   begin;
#   insert into events (..) values (..);
#   ```
# - Then, in another console:
#   ```
#   insert into events (..) values (..);
#   select * from events;
#   ```
#
# The result is that event sequence ID 2 is visible, but only when the first
# transaction commits is event sequence ID 1 visible.
#
# Why does this happen?
#
# Sequences in Postgres (and most other DBs) are not transactional, changes
# to the sequence are visible to other transactions immediately. Also, inserts
# from the forked writers may be executed in parallel by postgres.
#
# The process of inserting into a table that has a sequence or serial column is
# to first get the next sequence ID (changing global state), then perform the
# insert statement and later commit. In between these 2 steps the sequence ID
# is taken but not visible in the table until the insert statement is
# committed. Gaps in sequence IDs occur when a process takes a sequence ID and
# commits it while another process is in between those 2 steps.
#
# This means another transaction could have taken the next sequence
# ID and committed before that one commits, resulting in a gap in sequence ID's
# when reading.
#
# Why is this a problem?
#
# Event stream processors use the sequence ID to keep track of where they're up to
# in the events table. If a projector processes an event with sequence ID n, it
# assumes that the next event it needs to process will have a sequence ID > n.
# This approach isn't reliable when sequence IDs appear non-linearly, making it
# possible for event stream processors to skip over events.
#
# How does EventSourcery deal with this?
#
# EventSourcery uses n transaction level advisory lock to synchronise inserts
# to the events table within the writeEvents function. Alternatives:
#
# - Write events from 1 process only (serialize at the application level)
# - Detect gaps when reading events and allow time for in-flight transactions
# (the gaps) to commit.
# - Built in eventual consistency. Selects would be restricted to events older
# than 500ms-1s or the transaction timeout to give enough time for in-flight
# transactions to commit.
# - Only query events when catching up, after that rely on events to be
# delivered through the pub/sub mechanism. Given events would be received out
# of order under concurrent writes there's potential for processors to process
# a given event twice if they shutdown after processing a sequence that was
# part of a gap.
